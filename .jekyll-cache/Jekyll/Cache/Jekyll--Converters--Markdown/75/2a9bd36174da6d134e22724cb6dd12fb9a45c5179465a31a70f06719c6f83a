<p>It took us  longer than expected to be here. While there have been challenges and distractions along the way, the major hurdle we have had is that we have been sort of chasing perfection too much. Itâ€™s totally impressive to look totally impressive before getting out there. But then the question is do we really need to be so impressive to help people? At the core, we set up MedNeed to help people and now specifically help medical facilities and professionals get the equipment and supplies needed to deliver improved and affordable medical care to more people. And the question again is do we really need to be totally impressive to start being useful to our users?</p>
