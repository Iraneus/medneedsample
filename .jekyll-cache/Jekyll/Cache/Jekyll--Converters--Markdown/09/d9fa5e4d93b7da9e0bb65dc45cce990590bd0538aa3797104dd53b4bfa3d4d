<p>So happy to be finally graduating from the Founder Institute (FI) after 14 weeks of grueling work.</p>

<p>Many times I felt like dropping out of the program given the amount of work we are required to do plus other personal challenges, activities and distractions I had to deal with.</p>

<p>But then I decided Iâ€™m not leaving and that even if Iâ€™m asked to go, I will at least give reasons for why I should stay.</p>

<p>And now the program is finally completed even though the company building process is like just getting started.</p>

<p>Doing startup is hard but itâ€™s much easier with the right support system which the FI gives.</p>

<p>The mentors and the critical feedback have been invaluable. Overall the program has been impressive.</p>

<p>Thanks FI team for the support.</p>

<p>Perhaps I would have done more and gained more from the program if not for some of the additional challenges and pivots we have had to deal with. But then I see everything as part of the building and fortification process for better days ahead.</p>

<p>For now, any medical facilities that need money to buy medical equipment and supplies can talk to us.</p>
