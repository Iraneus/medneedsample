      <p>
        Beyond having well trained and qualified medical professionals, the major challenge in medical care delivery is unavailability of needed equipment. 
        Usually, the barriers are cost and inadequate financing.
      </p> 
      <p>
        To help solve this challenge, financing providers and vendors/manufacturers on MedNeed provide financing solutions including loans and offers to enable 
        more medical facilities and professionals acquire the equipment and supplies they need to deliver improved and affordable medical care to more people. 
      </p>
      <p>
        MedNeed is a great resource for information on a wide range of financial support and cost-saving programs for medical equipment and supplies.
