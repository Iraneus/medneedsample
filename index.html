      <p>
        MedNeed is a peer-to-peer lending platform for medical equipment and supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond having well trained and qualified medical professionals, the major challenge in medical care delivery is unavailability of essential equipment.
      </p> 
      <p>
        To solve this challenge, lenders and investors on MedNeed provide financing solutions to help medical facilities acquire the equipment and supplies they need. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Medical facilities are matched with financing solutions based on the nature of financing needed and the location.   
      </p>
      
      <!--  <p>
        MedNeed is fully available only to medical facilities in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        MedNeed is a great resource for information on a wide range of financial support and cost-saving programs for medical equipment and supplies.
