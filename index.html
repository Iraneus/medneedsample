      <p>
        Beyond having well trained and qualified medical professionals, the major challenge in medical care delivery is unavailability of equipment and supplies. Usually, the barrier is cost and inadequate financing.
      </p> 
      <p>
        MedNeed is <strong>improving access to medical care in communities</strong> by providing <em>financing solutions including offers, loans and other cost-saving programs</em> to enable more medical facilities and professionals acquire the equipment and supplies they need to deliver improved and affordable medical care to more people. 
      </p>
      <p>
        MedNeed is a great resource for users to turn to for information on a wide range of financial support and assistance programs for medical equipment and supplies.
