<h1>MedNeed Equipment Support Loan</h1>
<p>For health facilities that need loan for procurement of medical equipment and supplies.</p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<p>The health facility finds the equipment or MedNeed helps find the equipment through vendor partners who are pre-accredited for quality assurance
    The health facility pays at least half of the cost of the equipment and MedNeed provides the loan to pay the remaining part of the cost
    MedNeed may pay for the full cost of the equipment depending on the amount and the nature of equipment
    The health facility pays MedNeed back in four equal installments or less and at stipulated equal intervals
    Repayments are made with 4% interest on the repayment amount at each interval 
    The maximum duration for repayment is 12 months after which MedNeed will move to recover payment 
    Not paying the required amount at the required time attracts additional 1% penalty for that interval
    Users can only seek new loans only after fully completing payment on an existing loan
    Currently users can get up to N5, 000, 000 and the maximum amount varies based on equipment and facility</p>
