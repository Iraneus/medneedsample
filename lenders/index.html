      <p>We invite you to join us on MedNeed and help improve access to medical care in communities by providing loans and financing incentives to eligible medical facilities. </p> 
      <p>Loans with more suitable terms and other financing incentives help more medical facilities that need financing to procure more of the equipment and supplies they need to deliver improved and affordable care to more people. </p>
      <p>To provide financing on MedNeed, the financing provider must agree to the following terms: </p>
      <p><em>The financing provider should meet all applicable regulatory requirements and certifications as applicable and be willing to provide financing for medical equipment on more suitable terms. </em></p>
      <p><em>MedNeed reserves the right to withdraw the financing provider from the platform if found making any false claim or providing inadequate services to users. </em></p>
      <br>

      <p>The financing provider will be able to provide full or part of loans as applicable. </p>

      <p><strong>Processing Loans</strong></p>
      <p>Loan requests from prequalified and eligible medical facilities are sent to all relevant financing providers on MedNeed (based on each financing providerâ€™s preferences). </p>

      <p>The financing provider can choose to make a full or part offer or pass the request as it deems fit for each loan request. </p>
      <p>MedNeed presents the loan offers with the terms and requirements to the medical facilities for acceptance or rejection as they deem fit. </p>
      <p>As soon as a loan offer is accepted by a medical facility, MedNeed works with the financing provider to process the loan and provide the funds. </p>
      <p>After processing the loan, MedNeed works with the medical facility to ensure that the equipment is dully procured and delivered. </p>
      <p>The medical facility starts repayment as specified in the terms.</p>
