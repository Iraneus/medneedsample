      <p>The medical facility places request. </p>
      <p>MedNeed sends request to owners available to lend their equipment. </p>
      <p>MedNeed sends the terms from the lenders to the renter. </p>
      <p>The renter accepts the terms from the most suitable lender. </p>
      <p>The renter makes payment in accordance with the terms. </p>
      <p>The equipment can be used right at the lender's facility or the equipment can be moved to the renterâ€™s facility depending on the procedure, the equipment and the terms.</p>
