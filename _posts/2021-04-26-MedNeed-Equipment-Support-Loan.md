The MedNeed Equipment Support loan is for medical facilities and professionals who need loan for procurement of medical equipment and supplies. 

Description: 

The loan is provided directly by MedNeed for procurement of medical equipment and supplies only. 

The amount range is between $1000 to $15,000 and its equivalent. 

The interest rate is 6% of the loan amount. 
Available to licensed and certified medical facilities and professionals only. 

The maximum tenor of the loan is 12 months.

The medical facility pays MedNeed back in four equal installments or less and at stipulated equal intervals within 12 months.

The medical facility finds the equipment or MedNeed helps find the equipment through vendor partners who are pre-accredited for quality assurance.

The medical facility pays at least half of the cost of the equipment and MedNeed provides the loan to pay the remaining part of the cost. 

MedNeed may pay for the full cost of the equipment depending on the amount and the nature of equipment. 

Not paying the required amount at the required time attracts additional 1% penalty for that interval. 

Users can only seek new loans only after fully completing payment on an existing loan.

Users who need additional financial support can consider can be directed to partner banks and other financing providers.

Please share with other medical facilities and professionals.
