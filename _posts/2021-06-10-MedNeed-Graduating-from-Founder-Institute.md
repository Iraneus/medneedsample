<!-- Excerpt here before second image below -->
 So happy to be finally graduating from the Founder Institute (FI) after 14 weeks of grueling work. 

Many times I felt like dropping out of the program given the amount of work we are required to do plus other personal challenges, activities and distractions I had to deal with. 

But then I decided I’m not leaving and that even if I’m asked to go, I will at least give reasons for why I should stay. 

And now the program is finally completed even though the company building process is like just getting started.

Doing startup is hard but it’s much easier with the right support system which the FI gives.

The mentors and the critical feedback have been invaluable. Overall the program has been impressive.

Thanks FI team for the support. 

Perhaps I would have done more and gained more from the program if not for some of the additional challenges and pivots we have had to deal with. But then I see everything as part of the building and fortification process for better days ahead.

For now, any medical facilities that need money to buy medical equipment and supplies can talk to us.
